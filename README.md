# Philip Saa speaking terms

Hi! I'm delighted that you're interested in having me speak at your event. To ensure that all parties involved are on
the same page, I've forked Christian Heilmann's [presenter terms](https://github.com/codepo8/presenter-terms) to base my
own terms. While my experience might be limited, I will treat speaking at your event with the utmost respect and
professionalism. Therefore I want to make sure that there is no misconception on expecations and delivery.

    happy to make myself available for your attendees.

  - I can release my slides either before or after my participation at your event. Everything I create at/for your event

## My setup

I am pretty open to different ways of presenting, but here is my preferred setup.

- [x] I would like to use my own computer with an HDMI connection. (I will provide the correct dongle, if necessary)
- [x] If available, I would also prefer to use a remote clicker and/or a monitor where I can refer to my slides.

If I need to use a central computer instead of mine, please consider that it can limit the possibility to do any kind of
live demo.

## My expectations

Above all, I do expect to be treated as a professional, as I will do my part to contribute to the success of your event.
Communication between both parties is key, so please ensure you provide the following:

- [x] **Provide me with a specific or precise speaking slot.**
- [x] **Deliver a professional stage setup.**
- [x] **Professionally record audio and video.**

## Things can go wrong...

Even with the best intentions, there may be trouble and I might not be available for your event. You may also change
your mind. If that happens, here's what I want to happen.

- [x] When I can not attend for some reason or another, I will communicate it as-soon-as-possible.
- [x] I can assist you in finding a replacement presenter or alternative solution.
- [x] When, for some reason, you decide to slash my speaking slot, I expect you to cover any involved cost.

## Show stoppers

While I realize how difficult it is to organise events, there are a few things that I consider "Deal-breakers."

- [x] Your event does not have a code of conduct.
- [x] Your event doesn't cover travel/lodging expenses. (An exception can be made of local events in the Nürnberg area)
