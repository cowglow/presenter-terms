# Philip Saa speaking terms

Hello I am Philip and I am happy that you are interested in me speaking at your event. I forked Christian Heilmann's [presenter terms](https://github.com/codepo8/presenter-terms) to base my own terms.

Therefore I want to make sure that there is no misconception about what I expect and deliver.

## Show stoppers

I know it is hard to organise events, so I want to make sure that we are on the same level. Here is a list of things 
that I consider "Deal-breakers." 

* [x] Your event does not have a code of conduct.
* [x] And unless it's a local event in the Nürnberg area, I'm not willing to pay for my own travel/lodging expenses.

## My deliveries at your event

Here's what I will do when invited as a presenter at your event.

- [x] **Deliver a talk fitting talk for the intended audience, on time and sticking to the defined format and duration.** 
  - I want to know what time frame I am expected to present and what format you would like it to be in.
  - I will show up at the times you need me to be there and with with your AV personnel to ensure the equipment is functional. 
- [x] **Be available for event attendees.** 
  - Whether it's for networking, answering questions, providing feedback or simply sharing my experience, 
  - I am more than glad to make myself available for your attendees.
- [x] **Be available for other promotional parts of the event.** 
  - I am happy to do interviews, press or other related activities to help you promote your event.
  - I'll re-tweet, re-post and share.
- [x] **Share my slides and give full-release of any photography or video recordings.**
  - If there is a good enough connection, this normally happens right after the presentation.
  - Everything I create at your event will be licensed Creative Commons unless otherwise agreed. 

## My setup 

I am pretty open to different ways of presenting, but here is my preferred setup

- [x] I like to use my own computer with an HDMI connection. (I will provide the correct dongle, if necessary)
- [x] I would prefer to use a remote clicker and have a monitor where I can see my slides instead of having to refer to the screen behind me.

If I need to use a central computer instead of mine, please consider that it will limit the ability to do a "live coding/editing" demo.

## My expectations

I expect to be treated as a professional, and as I will do my part to ensure that your event will be a success, I also expect you to carry yourself accordingly.
Communication among parties is key, so please ensure you provide the following:

- [ ] **Provide me with a specific or precise speaking slot.** 
- [ ] **Deliver a professional stage setup.**
- [ ] **Professional quality A/V recording.** 
- [ ] **Keep me out of sponsorship discussions.**

## Things can go wrong... 

Even with the best intentions, there may be trouble and I might not be available for your event. You may also change your mind. If that happens, here's what I want to happen.

- [x] When I can not attend for some reason or another, I will communicate it as-soon-as-possible.
- [x] I can assist you in finding a replacement presenter or alternative solution.
- [x] When for some reason you decide to slash my speaking slot, I expect you to cover the cost involved for me.
